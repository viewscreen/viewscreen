## Run Viewscreen on a VPS

Running Viewscreen on a VPS is designed to be as simple as possible.

  * Public Docker image
  * Single static Go binary with assets bundled
  * Automatic TLS using Let's Encrypt
  * Redirects http to https
  * Works with a reverse proxy or standalone

### 1. Get a server

**Recommended Specs**

* Type: VPS or dedicated
* Distribution: Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)
* Memory: 1GB+
* Storage: 5GB+

**Recommended Providers**

* [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/)
* [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/)

### 2. Add a DNS record

Create a DNS `A` record in your domain pointing to your server's IP address.

**Example:** `viewscreen.example.com  A  172.16.1.1`

### 3. Enable Let's Encrypt

When enabled with the `--letsencrypt` flag, viewscreen runs a TLS ("SSL") https server on port 443. It also runs a standard web server on port 80 to redirect clients to the secure server.

**Requirements**

* Your server must have a publicly resolvable DNS record.
* Your server must be reachable over the internet on ports 80 and 443.


### 4. Standalone

```bash

# Install ffmpeg.
$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:jonathonf/ffmpeg-3
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y wget ffmpeg x264

# Download the viewscreen binary.
$ sudo wget -O /usr/bin/viewscreen https://github.com/viewscreen/viewscreen/raw/master/viewscreen-linux-amd64

# Make it executable.
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/viewscreen

# Allow it to bind to privileged ports 80 and 443.
$ sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/bin/viewscreen

# Enable Let's Encrypt using your domain for automatic TLS configuration.
$ viewscreen --http-host viewscreen.example.com --http-username $USER --download-dir $HOME/Downloads --letsencrypt
INFO[0000] viewscreen URL: https://viewscreen.example.com/viewscreen
INFO[0001] Login credentials: <username> / <password>

```

###  Run as a Docker container

The official image is `viewscreen/viewscreen`, which should run in any up-to-date Docker environment.

Follow the official Docker install instructions: [Get Docker CE for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

```bash

# Your download directory should be bind-mounted as `/data` inside the container using the `--volume` flag.
$ mkdir /home/<username>/Downloads

$ sudo docker create                            \
    --name viewscreen --init --restart always      \
    --publish 80:80 --publish 443:443           \
    --volume /home/<username>/Downloads:/data   \
    viewscreen/viewscreen:latest --letsencrypt --http-host viewscreen.example.com

$ sudo docker start viewscreen

$ sudo docker logs -f viewscreen
time="2027-01-19T00:00:00Z" level=info msg="viewscreen URL: https://viewscreen.example.com/viewscreen"
time="2027-01-19T00:00:00Z" level=info msg="Login credentials: viewscreen / 924433342"

INFO[0000] viewscreen URL: https://viewscreen.example.com/viewscreen
INFO[0001] Login credentials: viewscreen / 398032092

```

#### Updating the container image

Pull the latest image, remove the container, and re-create the container as explained above.

```bash
# Pull the latest image
$ sudo docker pull viewscreen/viewscreen

# Stop the container
$ sudo docker stop viewscreen

# Remove the container (data is stored on the mounted volume)
$ sudo docker rm viewscreen

# Re-create and start the container
$ sudo docker create ... (see above)

```

#### Using screen to run in debug mode

If you're having problems, it might help to run viewscreen in a screen session with debug logging enabled.

``` bash
# Install screen
$ screen || sudo apt-get install -y screen

# Launch in a detached screen session.
$ screen -S viewscreen -d -m viewscreen --debug --letsencrypt --http-host <your domain name>

# List all screen sessions.
$ screen -ls

# Attach to the running session.
$ screen -r viewscreen

# Press ctrl-a + ctrl-d to detach.
```

### Building

The easiest way to build the static binary is using the `Dockerfile.build` file. You can also build a docker image for running the binary.

```bash
# Download the git repo.
$ git clone https://github.com/viewscreen/viewscreen.git
$ cd viewscreen/

# Compile the code and create a Docker image for it.
$ sudo docker build --build-arg BUILD_VERSION=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) -t viewscreen:build -f Dockerfile.build .

# Create a container based on the image we just built.
$ sudo docker create --name viewscreenbuild viewscreen:build

# Extract the binary from the image.
$ sudo docker cp viewscreenbuild:/usr/bin/viewscreen-linux-amd64 viewscreen-linux-amd64

# We're done with the build container.
$ sudo docker rm viewscreenbuild

# Inspect the binary.
$ file viewscreen-linux-amd64
viewscreen-linux-amd64: ELF 64-bit LSB  executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=c2a6f5a9e12c8c35117ec52c3572bf844c510957, stripped

# Run the binary.
$ ./viewscreen-linux-amd64 --help

# Build a tiny alpine "runner" image.
$ sudo docker build -t viewscreen:latest .
```

### Thanks

Thanks to all the projects and developers that made this project possible.
